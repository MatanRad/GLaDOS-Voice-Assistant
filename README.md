# GLaDOS Assistant

The GLaDOS Assistant is an interactive voice-activated assistant inspired by the iconic character GLaDOS from the Portal video game series. By leveraging the power of the RIVA TTS model, Google's STT, Porcupine's wake word detection, and ChatGPT, this project brings GLaDOS to life with just a speaker and a microphone (or preferably, one of [these](https://us.ankerwork.com/products/a3308)).
